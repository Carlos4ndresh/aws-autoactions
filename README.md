# Manage EC2 Instances TTL through Lambda and Terraform
## This is a fork from Hashicorp Terraform-Guides Github Repo: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides

In this repository I've updated the syntax to Terraform 0.12.x.

### StatedÂ Purpose

Give governance to any AWS account main services with little configuration, and reaching zero expenses while doing so.

The idea is to include in the following months the following services:

    - RDS
    - DynamoDB
    - Lambda
    - S3
